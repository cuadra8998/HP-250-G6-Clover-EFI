# HP-250-G6-Clover-EFI
This EFI is for the i5 Version of the notebook. This is my first release of a EFI so don't be alarmed if it doesn't work for your PC. All EFI Releases will be at the Releases Tab on the right side of the Github Website. Have a safe Hackintosh Journey! (I WILL BE UPDATING TO A OPENCORE VERSION LATER DOWN THE LINE!)
