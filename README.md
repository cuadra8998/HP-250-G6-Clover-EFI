# HP-250-G6-Clover-EFI
This EFI is for the i5 Version of the notebook. This is my first release of a EFI so don't be alarmed if it doesn't work for your PC. All EFI Releases will be at the Releases Tab on the right side of the Github Website. Have a safe Hackintosh Journey! (I WILL BE UPDATING TO A OPENCORE VERSION LATER DOWN THE LINE!) Unfortunatley since this is Clover the max macOS version you can go to is 10.15.7. There are patches to include Big Sur, but for User Experience (I won't be including those since it breaks Catalina and Lower Booting)
