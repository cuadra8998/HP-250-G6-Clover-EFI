# HP-250-G6-Clover-EFI
This EFI is for the i5 Version of the notebook
Be warned that this in not a perfect EFI at all and may cause issues on your notebook
I advice you to make your own EFI as my EFI will probably not work on your PC
Whats Working:
-iMessage
-iCloud
-Facetime
-Intel WiFi (you will need to import the Airportitlwm kext into your L/E Directory so it will work at boot everytime)
Whats not Working:
-Card Reader (not suprising)
